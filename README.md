# Memory Game Project

## Project Purpose

This project is part of Udacity frontend nanodegree. The project purpose is to demonstrate the Javascript, css and HTML skills.

## About the game

The game shows a matrix of 16 cards shuffled randomly. This is a memory match game. There are 8 pairs of cards that are shuffled and the user needs to match all the 8 pairs.
Also displayed are information like time elapsed, star rating and an option to restart the game.
The user can flip any two cards and try to match them. If two flipped cards do not match, the cards automatically flip after a certain time. If the cards match, they are highlighted.
The time elapsed is measured. Also, the star rating is updated based on the number of moves used as the game progresses. 
When all the card pairs are matched, a popup dialog appears asking to restart the game.

### Special features
When the user hovers on a card, the card is scaled to show that it is active.
When two cards do not match, after a few seconds, they automatically flip to their original state.
When two cards match, they are highlighted.
